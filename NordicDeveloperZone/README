The files contained in this directory are available for download
from the blog article "BLE Sniffer in Linux using Wireshark"
on the Nordic Developer Zone site[1]

There is no license associated to these files so I assume they
can freely distributed and modified.

Note: as reported in the blog, example_linux.py does not compile
due to a missing ':' at the end of line 47.
